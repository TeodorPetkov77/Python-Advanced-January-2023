# 2.	Students' Grades
# Write a program that reads students' names and their grades and adds them to the student record.
# On the first line, you will receive the number of students â€“ N. On the following N lines, you will be receiving a student's name and grade.
# For each student print all his/her grades and finally his/her average grade, formatted to the second decimal point in the format: "{student's name} -> {grade1} {grade2} ... {gradeN} (avg: {average_grade})".
# The order in which we print the result does not matter.
# Examples
# Input	Output
# 7
# Peter 5.20
# Mark 5.50
# Peter 3.20
# Mark 2.50
# Alex 2.00
# Mark 3.46
# Alex 3.00	Mark -> 5.50 2.50 3.46 (avg: 3.82)
# Peter -> 5.20 3.20 (avg: 4.20)
# Alex -> 2.00 3.00 (avg: 2.50)
# 4
# Scott 4.50
# Ted 3.00
# Scott 5.00
# Ted 3.66	Ted -> 3.00 3.66 (avg: 3.33)
# Scott -> 4.50 5.00 (avg: 4.75)
