# 5.	Word Count
# Write a program that reads a list of words from the file words.txt and finds how many times each of the words is contained in another file text.txt. Matching should be case-insensitive.
# The results should be written to other text files. Sort the words by frequency in descending order.
# Examples
# words.txt	input.txt	output.txt
